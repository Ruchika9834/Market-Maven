Toothpaste products designed for daily use, including those with fluoride, whitening agents, and breath-freshening properties, cater to this widespread need. This segment's growth is supported by the rising consumer emphasis on preventive dental care and the continual introduction of new and innovative toothpaste formulations by leading brands.
